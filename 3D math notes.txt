Trying to turn x and z rotation into global coordinates

azimuth is just y rotation (currently z rotation for backwards compatability, probably change later)

the proportion of the composition of polar angle
from x and z rotations is based on the azimuth angle

rotation on polar is
at 0   degrees azimuth, positive rotation in the z axis
at 90  degrees azimuth, positive rotation in the x axis
at 180 degrees azimuth, negative rotation in the z axis
at 270 degrees azimuth, negative rotation in the x axis

proportion of x axis rotation in polar
sin(a)

proportion of z axis rotation in polar
cos(a)

first draft formula
p = sin(a) * x + cos(a) * z

not acceptable since sin(a)+cos(a)>1 sometimes.


Another possible formula?
p = (sin(a)/(sin(a)+cos(a)) * x) + (cos(a)/(sin(a)+cos(a)) * z)

gives proportional representation
because a/a+b + b/a+b = 1 is always true


Need to fix polar rotation inclusion first before implementing this.
